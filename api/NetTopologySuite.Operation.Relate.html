For each geometry all self-intersection nodes are computed and added to the graph. Compute nodes for all intersections between edges and nodes of the graphs.

Labeling isolated components  Isolated components are components (edges or nodes) of an input Geometry which do not contain any intersections with the other input Geometry. The topological relationship of these components to the other input Geometry must be computed in order to determine the complete labeling of the component. This can be done by testing whether the component lies in the interior or exterior of the other Geometry. If the other Geometry is 1-dimensional, the isolated component must lie in the exterior (since otherwise it would have an intersection with an edge of the Geometry). If the other Geometry is 2-dimensional, a Point-In-Polygon test can be used to determine whether the isolated component is in the interior or exterior.

      <section><p>Computes the topological relationship between two Geometries.
RelateComputer does not need to build a complete graph structure to compute
the IntersectionMatrix.  The relationship between the geometries can
be computed by simply examining the labelling of edges incident on each node.
RelateComputer does not currently support arbitrary GeometryCollections.
This is because GeometryCollections can contain overlapping Polygons.
In order to correct compute relate on overlapping Polygons, they
would first need to be noded and merged (if not explicitly, at least
implicitly).</p>

      <section><p>Implements the simple graph of Nodes and EdgeEnd which is all that is
required to determine topological relationships between Geometries.
Also supports building a topological graph of a single Geometry, to
allow verification of valid topology.
It is not necessary to create a fully linked
PlanarGraph to determine relationships, since it is sufficient
to know how the Geometries interact locally around the nodes.
In fact, this is not even feasible, since it is not possible to compute
exact intersection points, and hence the topology around those nodes
cannot be computed robustly.
The only Nodes that are created are for improper intersections;
that is, nodes which occur at existing vertices of the Geometries.
Proper intersections (e.g. ones which occur between the interior of line segments)
have their topology determined implicitly, without creating a Node object
to represent them.</p>
