  <div class="markdown level0 summary">
<p>Contains classes that perform vector overlay to compute boolean set-theoretic spatial functions.
Overlay operations are used in spatial analysis for computing set-theoretic operations (boolean combinations) of input <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.Geometry.html">Geometry</a> s.</p>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.OverlayNG.html">OverlayNG</a> class provides the standard Simple Features
boolean set-theoretic overlay operations.<br>
These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intersection</strong> - all points which lie in both geometries</li>
<li><strong>Union</strong> - all points which lie in at least one geometry</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong> - all points which lie in the first geometry but not the second</li>
<li><strong>Symmetric Difference</strong> - all points which lie in one geometry but not both</li>
</ul>
<p>These operations are supported for all combinations of the basic geometry types and their homogeneous collections.</p>
<p>Additional operations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Union.UnaryUnionOp.html">UnaryUnion</a> unions collections of geometries in an efficient way</li>
<li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.CoverageUnion.html">CoverageUnion</a> provides enhanced performance for unioning valid polygonal and lineal coverages</li>
<li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.PrecisionReducer.html">PrecisionReducer</a> allows reducing the precision of a geometry in a topologically-valid way</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="semantics">Semantics</h2>
<p>The requirements for overlay input are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input geometries may have different dimension.</li>
<li>Collections must be homogeneous<br>
(all elements must have the same dimension).</li>
<li>In general, inputs must be valid geometries.</li>
<li>However, polygonal inputs may contain the following two kinds of &quot;mild&quot; invalid topology:
<ul>
<li>rings which self-touch at discrete points (sometimes called inverted shells and exverted holes).</li>
<li>rings which touch along line segments (i.e. topology collapse).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The semantics of overlay output are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Results are always valid geometries.<br>
In particular, result <code>MultiPolygon</code>s are valid.</li>
<li>Repeated vertices are removed</li>
<li>Linear results include all nodes (endpoints) present in the input.
In some cases more nodes will be present.
(If merged lines are required see <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Linemerge.LineMerger.html">LineMerger</a>.)</li>
<li>Polygon edges which undergo topology collapse to lines
(due to rounding or snapping) are included in the result.
This means that all operations may produce a heterogeneous result.
Usually this only occurs when using a fixed-precision model,
but it can happen due to snapping performed to improve robustness.</li>
<li>The <code>intersection</code> operation result includes all components of the
intersection for geometries which intersect in components of the same and/or
lower dimension.</li>
<li>The <code>difference</code> operation produces a homogeneous result if no topology
collapses are present.<br>
In this case the result dimension is equal to that of the left-hand operand.</li>
<li>The <code>union</code> and <code>symmetric difference</code> operations
may produce heterogeneous result if the inputs are of mixed dimension.</li>
<li>Homogeneous results are output as <code>Multi</code> geometries.</li>
<li>Heterogeneous results are output as a <code>GeometryCollection</code>
containing a set of atomic geometries.<br>
(This provides backwards compatibility
with the original NTS overlay implementation.
However, it loses the information that the polygonal results
have valid <code>MultiPolygon</code> topology.)</li>
<li>Empty results are atomic <code>EMPTY</code> geometries of dimension appropriate
to the operation.</li>
<li>As far as possible, results preserve the order and direction of the inputs.
For instance, a MultiLineString intersection with a Polygon
will have resultants which are in the same order and have the same direction
as the input lines (assuming the input lines are disjoint).
If an input line is split into two or more parts,
they are ordered in the direction of occurence along their parent line.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pluggable-noding">Pluggable Noding</h2>
<p>The noding phase of overlay uses a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.INoder.html">INoder</a> subclass. This is determine automatically based on the precision model of the input. Or it can be provided explicity, which allows changing characteristics of performance and robustness. Examples of relevant noders include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.MCIndexNoder.html">MCIndexNoder</a> - a fast full-precision noder, which however may not produce
a valid noding in some situations. Should be combined with a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.ValidatingNoder.html">ValidatingNoder</a> wrapper to detect
noding failures.</li>
<li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.Snap.SnappingNoder.html">SnappingNoder</a> - a robust full-precision noder</li>
<li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.Snapround.SnapRoundingNoder.html">SnapRoundingNoder</a> - a noder which enforces a supplied fixed precision model

<li><span class="xref">SegmentExtractingNoder</span> - requires node-clean input, and provides very fast noding</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topology-correction--conversion">Topology Correction / Conversion</h2>
<p>As noted above, the overlay process
can handle polygonal inputs which are invalid according to the OGC topology model
in certain limited ways.
These invalid conditions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>rings which self-touch at discrete points (sometimes called inverted shells and exverted holes).</li>
<li>rings which touch along line segments (i.e. topology collapse).</li>
</ul>
<p>These invalidities are corrected during the overlay process.</p>
<p>Some of these invalidities are considered as valid in other geometry models.
By peforming a self-overlay these inputs can be converted
into the JTS OGC topological model.</p>
<h2 id="codebase">Codebase</h2>
<ul>
<li>Defines a simple, full-featured topology model, with clear semantics.

<li>Uses a simpler topology graph data structure (based on winged edge pattern).</li>
<li>Decouples noding and topology-build phases. This makes the code clearer, and makes it possible to allow supplying alternate implementations and semantics for each phase.</li>
<li>All optimizations are implemented internally, so that clients do not have to add checks such as envelope overlap&lt;./li&gt;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>For non-point inputs the overlay algorithm is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check for empty input geometries, and return a result appropriate for the specified operation</li>
<li>Extract linework and points from input geometries, with topology location information</li>
<li>(If optimization enabled) Apply overlap envelope optimizations:
<ol>
<li>For Intersection, check if the input envelopes are disjoint (using an envelope expansion adjustment to account for the precision grid).</li>
<li>For Intersection and Difference, clip or limit the linework of the input geometries to the overlap envelope.</li>
<li>If the optimized linework is empty, return an empty result of appropriate type.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Node the linework. For full robustness snap-rounding noding is used. Other kinds of noder can be used as well (for instance, the full-precision noding algorithm as the original overlay code).</li>
<li>Merge noded edges. Coincident edges from the two input geometries are merged, along with their topological labelling. Topology collapses are detected in this step, and are flagged in the labelling so they can be handled appropriately duing result polygon extraction</li>
<li>Build a fully-labelled topology graph. This includes:
<ol>
<li>Create a graph structure on the noded, merged edges</li>

      <h4><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.CoverageUnion.html">CoverageUnion</a></h4>
      <section><p>Unions a valid coverage of polygons or lines
in an efficient way.</p>
<p>
A valid polygonal coverage is a collection of <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.Polygon.html">Polygon</a>s
which satisfy the following conditions:
<ol><li>Vector-cleanLine segments within the collection
must either be identical or intersect only at endpoints.</li><li>Non-overlappingNo two polygons
may overlap. Equivalently, polygons must be interior-disjoint.</li></ol>
<p>
A valid linear coverage is a collection of <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.LineString.html">LineString</a>s
which satisfies the <strong>Vector-clean</strong> condition.
Note that this does not require the LineStrings to be fully noded
- i.e. they may contain coincident linework.
Coincident line segments are dissolved by the union.
Currently linear output is not merged (this may be added in a future release.)
<p>
Currently no checking is done to determine whether the input is a valid coverage.
This is because coverage validation involves segment intersection detection,
which is much more expensive than the union phase.
If the input is not a valid coverage
then in some cases this will be detected during processing 
and a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a> is thrown.
Otherwise, the computation will produce output, but it will be invalid.
<p>
Unioning a valid coverage implies that no new vertices are created.
This means that a precision model does not need to be specified.
The precision of the vertices in the output geometry is not changed.
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.LineLimiter.html">LineLimiter</a></h4>
      <section><p>Limits the segments in a list of segments
to those which intersect an envelope.
This creates zero or more sections of the input segment sequences,
containing only line segments which intersect the limit envelope.
Segments are not clipped, since that can move
line segments enough to alter topology,
and it happens in the overlay in any case.
This can substantially reduce the number of vertices which need to be
processed during overlay.</p>
<p>
This optimization is only applicable to Line geometries,
since it does not maintain the closed topology of rings.
Polygonal geometries are optimized using the <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.RingClipper.html">RingClipper</a>.
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.OverlayNG.html">OverlayNG</a></h4>
      <section><p>Computes the geometric overlay of two <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.Geometry.html">Geometry</a>s,
using an explicit precision model to allow robust computation.</p>
<p>
The overlay can be used to determine any of the
following set-theoretic operations (boolean combinations) of the geometries:
<ul><li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Overlay.SpatialFunction.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_Overlay_SpatialFunction_Intersection">Intersection</a>all points which lie in both geometries</li><li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Overlay.SpatialFunction.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_Overlay_SpatialFunction_Union">Union</a>all points which lie in at least one geometry</li><li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Overlay.SpatialFunction.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_Overlay_SpatialFunction_Difference">Difference</a>all points which lie in the first geometry but not the second</li><li><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Overlay.SpatialFunction.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_Overlay_SpatialFunction_SymDifference">SymDifference</a>all points which lie in one geometry but not both</li></ul>
Input geometries may have different dimension.
Input collections must be homogeneous (all elements must have the same dimension).
<p>
The precision model used for the computation can be supplied
independent of the precision model of the input geometry.
The main use for this is to allow using a fixed precision
for geometry with a floating precision model.
This does two things: ensures robust computation;
and forces the output to be validly rounded to the precision model.
<p>
For fixed precision models noding is performed using a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.Snapround.SnapRoundingNoder.html">SnapRoundingNoder</a>.
This provides robust computation(as long as precision is limited to
around 13 decimal digits).
<p>
For floating precision an <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.MCIndexNoder.html">MCIndexNoder</a> is used.
This is not fully robust, so can sometimes result in 
<a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a>s being thrown.
For robust full-precision overlay see <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.OverlayNGRobust.html">OverlayNGRobust</a>.
<p>
A custom <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.INoder.html">INoder</a> can be supplied.
This allows using a more performant noding strategy in specific cases,
for instance in <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.CoverageUnion.html">CoverageUnion</a>.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.Snap.SnappingNoder.html">SnappingNoder</a> is used
it is best to specify a fairly small snap tolerance,
since the intersection clipping optimization can
interact with the snapping to alter the result.
<p>
Optionally the overlay computation can process using strict mode
(via <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.OverlayNG.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_OverlayNG_OverlayNG_StrictMode">StrictMode</a> = <code>true</code>).
In strict mode result semantics are:
<ul><li>Lines and Points resulting from topology collapses are not included in the result</li><li>Result geometry is homogeneous
for the <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Overlay.SpatialFunction.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_Overlay_SpatialFunction_Intersection">Intersection</a> and <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Overlay.SpatialFunction.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_Overlay_SpatialFunction_Difference">Difference</a> operations.</li><li>Result geometry is homogeneous
for the <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Overlay.SpatialFunction.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_Overlay_SpatialFunction_Union">Union</a> and <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.Overlay.SpatialFunction.html#NetTopologySuite_Operation_Overlay_SpatialFunction_SymDifference">SymDifference</a> operations
if the inputs have the same dimension</li></ul>
Strict mode has the following benefits:
<ul><li>Results are simpler</li><li>Overlay operations are easily chainable
without needing to remove lower-dimension elements</li></ul>
The original JTS overlay semantics corresponds to non-strict mode.
<p>
If a robustness error occurs, a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a> is thrown.
These are usually caused by numerical rounding causing the noding output
to not be fully noded.
For robust computation with full-precision <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.OverlayNGRobust.html">OverlayNGRobust</a>
can be used.
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.OverlayNGRobust.html">OverlayNGRobust</a></h4>
      <section><p>Performs an overlay operation using <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.OverlayNG.html">OverlayNG</a>,
increasing robustness by using a series of
increasingly robust (but slower) noding strategies.</p>
<p>
The noding strategies used are:
<ol><li>A simple fast noder using <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.PrecisionModels.html#NetTopologySuite_Geometries_PrecisionModels_Floating">Floating</a> precision</li><li>A <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.Snap.SnappingNoder.html">SnappingNoder</a> using an automatically-determined snap tolerance</li><li>First snapping each geometry to itself, and then overlaying them wih a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.Snap.SnappingNoder.html">SnappingNoder</a></li><li>The above two strategies are repeated with increasing snap tolerance, up to a limit</li><li>Finally a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.Snapround.SnapRoundingNoder.html">SnapRoundingNoder</a> is used with a automatically-determined scale factor.</li></ol>
If all of the above heuristics fail to compute a valid overlay,
the original <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a> is thrown.
In practice this should be extremely unlikely to occur.
<p>
This algorithm relies on each overlay operation execution
throwing a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Geometries.TopologyException.html">TopologyException</a> if it is unable
to compute the overlay correctly.
Generally this occurs because the noding phase does
not produce a valid noding.
This requires the use of a <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Noding.ValidatingNoder.html">ValidatingNoder</a>
in order to check the results of using a floating noder.

      <section><p>Clips a ring of points to an rectangle.
Uses a variant of Cohen-Sutherland clipping.</p>
<p>
In general the output is not topologically valid.
In particular, the output may contain coincident non-noded line segments
along the clip rectangle sides.
However, the output is sufficiently well-structured
that it can be used as input to the <a class="xref" href="NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.OverlayNG.html">OverlayNG</a> algorithm
(which is able to process coincident linework due
to the need to handle topology collapse under precision reduction).
<p>
Because of the likelihood of creating
extraneous line segments along the clipping rectangle sides,
this class is not suitable for clipping linestrings.
<p>
The clipping envelope should be generated using <span class="xref">NetTopologySuite.Operation.OverlayNG.RobustClipEnvelopeComputer</span>,
to ensure that intersecting line segments are not perturbed
by clipping.
This is required to ensure that the overlay of the
clipped geometry is robust and correct (i.e. the same as
if clipping was not used).
