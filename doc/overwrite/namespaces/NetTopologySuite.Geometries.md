The .Net Topology Suite (NTS) is a .Net API that implements a core set of spatial data operations using an explicit precision model and robust geometric algorithms. NTS is intended to be used in the development of applications that support the validation, cleaning, integration and querying of spatial datasets.  
It is a direct port of the popular Java Topology Suite (JTS).

NTS attempts to implement the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification (SFS) as accurately as possible. In some cases the SFS is unclear or omits a specification; in this case NTS attempts to choose a reasonable and consistent alternative. Differences from and elaborations of the SFS are documented in this specification.
