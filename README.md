A .NET GIS solution that is fast and reliable for the .NET platform.  
**NetTopologySuite** is a direct-port of all the functionalities offered by JTS Topology Suite: _NTS expose JTS in a '.NET way'_, as example using Properties, Indexers etc...

An excerpt from [JTS website](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite) explains the capabilities of NTS too:  
_"The JTS Topology Suite is an API for modelling and manipulating 2-dimensional linear geometry. It provides numerous geometric predicates and functions. JTS conforms to the Simple Features Specification for SQL published by the Open GIS Consortium."_
