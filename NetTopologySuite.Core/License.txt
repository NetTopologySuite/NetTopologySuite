NetTopologySuite is a collection of .NET classes written in C# that
implement the fundamental operations required to validate a given
geo-spatial data set to a known topological specification.

This collection of classes is a porting (with some additions and modifications) of 
JTS Topology Suite (see next license for more informations).
